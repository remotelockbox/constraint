# Constraint

A kinky scene generator for use by individuals or with partners.
It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book but you write the story and the computer chooses for you.

This program is driven by information about what items you have available
to you and what kinds of scenes you want to carry out.

Your items are managed in `inventory.yaml` where you can add or remove items,
change the odds of them appearing in a scene, or tag them with categories that
affect what situations they'll be chosen for.

The `scenarios` directory is where individual scenarios are stored.
You can craft your own scenarios using the included ones as inspiration.
